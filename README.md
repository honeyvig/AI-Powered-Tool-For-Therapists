# AI-Powered-Tool-For-Therapists
We want to help therapists to think like Dave (Our CEO) when presented with tricky cases with the use of Al to speed the process up for them.

- Ability to take pre-assessment form & assess the information and give recommendations and guidance tips for therapists before they see pt.
- Ability to continually test and update Al based on latest clinical findings and patient notes from our therapists successes of what we did.
- Ability to feed Al hours and hours of Dave's coaching calls, methodology, case studies to think like Dave accurately 90% of the time.
- Ability to take Pre-assessment form and plot like the patient's 'storyboard' prior to initial assessment.

So it would essentially be a chatbot tool that they could ask questions regarding tricky cases in physiotherapy and it would then tell them the best recommendations based on Dave's knowledge but also a pre-assessment form tool for them to complete the form and then it will assess the information and give recommendations and guidance.
==================
Below is a Python implementation for creating an AI-powered tool for therapists, designed to function as a chatbot that can analyze pre-assessment forms, provide recommendations, and learn from historical data such as coaching calls and patient success stories.

This solution uses OpenAI's GPT model for language processing and integrates data pipelines for updating its knowledge base over time. The chatbot also includes functionality for uploading pre-assessment forms and generating patient storyboards.

Key Features:

    Pre-Assessment Form Analysis:
        Upload forms as text files.
        Parse and analyze the content to provide recommendations using Dave's methodology.

    Tricky Case Handling:
        Submit complex cases to the AI for tailored advice.
        Leverages OpenAI GPT fine-tuned prompts to align with Daveâ€™s principles.

    Continuous Learning:
        Integrate additional data over time, such as:
            Hours of coaching calls transcribed into structured data.
            Feedback from patient outcomes.
            Regular updates to "daves_knowledge_base" for evolving clinical practices.

    Dynamic Storyboard Creation:
        Future expansions can visualize patient progress using a dashboard.
        Leverage frameworks like matplotlib or Plotly for plotting patient storyboards.

API Endpoints:

    /upload_form: For uploading and processing pre-assessment forms.
    /tricky_case: For analyzing tricky physiotherapy cases.

Deployment Steps:

    Install dependencies:

pip install flask openai

Replace "your_openai_api_key" with your OpenAI API key.
Start the app:

    python app.py

    Use tools like Postman or a simple frontend to interact with the endpoints.

Future Enhancements:

    Data Labeling: Use structured pre-assessment data to fine-tune GPT for improved accuracy.
    Visualization Dashboard: Add a web-based interface for therapists to see patient storyboards.
    Integration with EHR: Link with electronic health records for comprehensive patient profiles.
    Mobile App: Deploy the chatbot as part of a mobile app for therapists
